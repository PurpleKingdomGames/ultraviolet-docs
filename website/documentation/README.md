# Ultraviolet

[Ultraviolet](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/ultraviolet) is a Scala 3 to GLSL 100/300 'inline' transpiler library.

You can use Ultraviolet to generate GLSL shader code for any WebGL use case, such as with [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), but is primarily designed to support [Indigo](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo).

All the shader examples and demos in these docs are written in [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/ultraviolet) and presented using [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/).
