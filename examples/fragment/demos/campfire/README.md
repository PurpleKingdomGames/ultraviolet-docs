# Campfire Demo

This tiny diorama aims to show how you could use shaders to generate dynamic pixel art, in this case the flames of a campfire.

As usual, I'm borrowing from the work of Inigo Quilez, specifically for two things here:

1. A [Gradient noise](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/gradientnoise/gradientnoise.htm) implementation.
2. The [Circle SDF](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions2d/distfunctions2d.htm) function.
